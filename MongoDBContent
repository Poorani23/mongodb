   - Set the additional cluster configurations according to your preferences, such as the cluster name and shared or dedicated cluster options.
   - Click on the "Create Cluster" button to start creating the cluster.

4. Wait for Cluster Creation:
   - MongoDB Atlas will now create your cluster. The process may take a few minutes.
   - You can monitor the cluster creation progress on the MongoDB Atlas dashboard. Once the cluster is ready, it will be listed as "Active."

5. Configure Cluster Settings (Optional):
   - You can further configure your cluster settings by clicking on the "Clusters" tab in the MongoDB Atlas dashboard.
   - Here, you can modify settings such as cluster scaling, backup configurations, and more.

6. Connect to Your Cluster:
   - To connect to your cluster, click on the "Connect" button for your cluster in the MongoDB Atlas dashboard.
   - Choose the connection method based on your application's requirements (e.g., application connection, MongoDB Compass, etc.).
   - Follow the instructions provided to establish the connection to your cluster.

 Now use this cluster to store your MongoDB databases and perform CRUD operations using our preferred method of connection.
 
 
 **Create a database to store data in the student's database in MongoDB compass**


To create a database for storing data in the "students" database using MongoDB Compass, you can follow these steps:

1. Open MongoDB Compass:
   - Launch MongoDB Compass on your computer.

2. Connect to MongoDB Atlas:
   - In the MongoDB Compass connection screen, click on the "New Connection" button.
   - Enter your MongoDB Atlas connection details, including the connection string or hostname, username, and password.
   - Click on the "Connect" button to establish a connection to your MongoDB Atlas cluster.

3. Create a Database:
   - Once connected, you will see the list of databases on the left-hand side of the Compass interface.
   - Click on the "+ Create Database" button to create a new database.
   - Enter the name "students" for the database and press Enter or click outside the field to create the database.

4. Create a Collection:
   - With the "students" database selected, click on the "+ Create Collection" button.
   - Enter a name for the collection, such as "student details," and press Enter or click outside the field to create the collection.

5. Define Collection Schema (Optional):
   - If you want to define a specific schema for your student details, you can do so by clicking on the "Schema" tab within the collection view.
   - Here, you can define the fields, their types, and any validation rules.

6. Insert Data:
   - To insert data into the "student details" collection, click on the "Documents" tab within the collection view.
   - Click on the "+ Insert Document" button to add a new document.
   - Enter the student details as key-value pairs according to your defined schema or the default BSON format.
   - Click on the "Insert" button to save the document.

Now create a database named "students" and a collection named "studentDetails" in MongoDB Compass. Continue inserting more documents into the collection by repeating the steps mentioned in the "Insert Data" section.
